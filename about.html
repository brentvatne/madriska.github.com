<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>Madriska Media Group began as a husband-and-wife team dedicated to web and application development. Madriska is now much larger than our small beginnings. We started this business out of an overflow of the interests and work we were already involved in. When people began asking us, &#8220;Hey, why don&#8217;t you do this full time?&#8221; We thought, &#8220;Why not?&#8221; We already love it! Now, we focus our love and energy towards making Madriska Media Group the best that it can be. We are especially focused on making our business ethical and fair.</p>

<p>Because our company is involved at the very edge of the latest technologies, we are always learning and improving our own skills. We study the latest programming languages and platforms and scour the web for up-and-coming designs. Development and design are as familiar to us as an old friend, and we bring that friendship into our dedication to our work.</p>
