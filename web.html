<h1>Web Services</h1>

<h2>Web Identity</h2>

<p>Your website says a lot about your company. Hopefully, it says that you are dedicated and reliable. Too often, customers
   may turn away from a company because of a poorly designed or hard-to-use website. We want to make a trip to your site a 
   joy for your customers.</p>

<p>We will work with you to develop the best site for your company. We are focused on great communication so that you best
   understand the web development process and make sure that your site meets your company&#8217;s needs.</p> 

<h2>Content Management Systems</h2>

<p>You don&#8217;t want to be tied to a programmer for life. And we don&#8217;t want you to have to spend your money to 
   change one sentence on your website a year from now. A content management system gives you the ability to change text
   and photos on your own website.</p>
   
<p>Please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> if you would like more information about implementing a CMS on your
   site. We use a number of content management systems, and are also in the process of developing our own. Ask us about 
   building your site in a content management system.</p>
